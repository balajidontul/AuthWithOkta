Project Summary: Authentication with Okta Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate Okta for OAuth2 authentication in a Spring Boot application. It includes configuration files and controllers to enable secure authentication and authorization.

Key Features:

Security Configuration (SecurityConfig.java):
Configures Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization.
Sets up OAuth2 login with Okta.
Defines custom logout behavior to redirect users to Okta's logout endpoint.
Controller for Home Page (HomeController.java):
Handles requests to the home page ("/").
Retrieves the currently authenticated user principal using @AuthenticationPrincipal.
Returns the name of the view template for rendering the home page.
Technologies Used:

Spring Boot
Spring Security
Thymeleaf (for server-side HTML templating)
Okta (for OAuth2 authentication)
How to Run:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up your Okta account and configure the application properties (application.properties or application.yml) with your Okta issuer URL and client ID.
Run the Spring Boot application.
Access the application through a web browser.
Additional Notes:

Ensure proper configuration of Okta settings for seamless integration.
Customize the project as per your requirements, such as adding additional security features or modifying the UI.
